I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University. 

Prior to my current appointment, I was a Senior Research Scientist at the AWS AI Labs, Amazon (2020-2022) in Santa Clara, CA.

Before Amazon, I was a Research Staff Member of the [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, IBM Research](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/nghia-hoang/) in Cambridge, MA (2018-2020).

Before IBM, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/) (LIDS), MIT (2017-2018). 

Prior to MIT, I was a Research Fellow at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) (2015-2017) where I earned my PhD degree in Machine Learning (2010-2015). 

My PhD adviser is [Associate Professor Kian Hsiang Low](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh).
