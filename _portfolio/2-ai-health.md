**Research Funding:**

<p align="justify">

I and my academic collaborators, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/dallab/people/index.html">Douglas A. Lauffenburger</a> (MIT) and <a href="https://smaglia.wordpress.com/">Sara Magliacane</a> (University of Amsterdam), were awarded an exploratory research grant (150K USD) to investigate new challenges in <b>Cross-Species Translation of COVID-19 Systems Serology Data for Infection and Vaccine Treatment</b> by the <a href="https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/">MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab</a> (2020-2021).

**Idea and Motivation:**

<p align="justify">

I am interested in application of ML to healthcare. Two important desiderata of ML models for healthcare applications are (1) transferability where knowledge learned from one domain can be transferred effectively to another and (2) interpretability via data prototyping where models whose predictions at prototypical data points are interpretable.
